# Learning-Management-System-OOP-
The Bahria LMS project is designed to automate and digitize academic workflows at Bahria University. It handles student management, course enrollments, faculty records, assignment submissions, and attendance tracking, all within a secure, role-based system. By leveraging OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and composition, the system ensures code modularity and reusability.

The project also integrates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Qt, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience for Admins, Teachers, and Students. Persistent data storage is achieved using file handling, ensuring that user information, grades, and attendance are reliably maintained.

Key Features:

Secure login and role-based access control.

Admin panel for managing users and courses.

Teacher panel for grading, content uploading, and attendance tracking.

Student panel for viewing grades, downloading resources, and submitting assignments.

File-based data persistence for reliability.# Learning-Management-System-OOP-
